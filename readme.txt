This app was made with Java Springboot framework, JPA, and MAVEN.  it's a CRUD for registering reports from citizens to the town hall, and following up on them.  it uses a database loaded in MYSQL and consulted by JPA instead of ODB like older java versions.  this project was loaded in google cloud but it can be loaded and any server by creating an image with docker RedHat or something like
